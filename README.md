# School_District_Analysis
 
## Overview of Project
# Purpose
Grade altering was detected at Thomas High School that affected the integrity of the grades submitted for the 9th grade class.    To uphold the guidelines of the state-testing standards, the grades for the 9th grade class were removed and replaced with NaN.   The initial School District Analysis was reconfigured to exclude the grades for the 9th grade class from Thomas High School.

Comparisons were done between the initial School District Analysis and the reconfigured final School District Analysis after the altered grades were removed.

## Results
# Affects

How is the district summary affected?
    The district summary was slightly affected as the % Overall Passing dropped 0.3%


How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
    The school summary was affected as removing the grades for the 9th grade class significantly dropped the Passing Math and Reading percentages for Thomas High School.  Once reconfiguration was done to adjust the student count, the percentages increased significantly.


How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
    The affect on math and reading scores only affected the 9th grade for Thomas High School.   Being the grades were removed, they have no standing in the analysis.

Scores by school spending
    The scores by school spending for the $630-644 range dropped slightly.

Scores by school size
Scores by school type
    Scores by school size and school type  had very minimal change.  Due to rounding, the numbers remained the same.


## Summary
The removal of the Thomas High School 9th grade scores had minimal affect on the summary tables for the average scores but it did cause a sizeable decrease in the overall passing percentages as well as the individual percentages for the math passing and reading passing categories.
